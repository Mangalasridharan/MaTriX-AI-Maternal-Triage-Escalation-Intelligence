# MaTriX-AI Features

## 1. Offline-First Edge Triage

The system executes primary maternal triage completely offline using a local **MedGemma 4B** model running via Ollama. This ensures that resource-constrained clinics with unstable internet can still receive instant (<2 seconds) risk assessments for symptoms like hemorrhage, sepsis, or preeclampsia.

## 2. Self-Correcting Agentic Swarm

Beyond basic inference, MaTriX-AI uses a **LangGraph-driven Swarm**. A dedicated **Critique Agent** reviews the management plans generated by the Guideline Agent. If it detects unsafe dosages or logical gaps, it automatically triggers a self-correction rewrite before the clinician sees the results.

## 3. Multi-Cloud Dynamic Escalation

The system dispatches critical cases to the **Cloud API** with flexible infrastructure support. It can utilize either **AWS SageMaker** (via native Boto3 integration) or **HuggingFace Inference Endpoints**. This allows the heavier **Gemma-2-27B** model to provide executive-level care plans for high-risk obstetric emergencies.

## 4. "Spatial Editorial" Analytics

The new **Analytics Intelligence** layer provides high-fidelity population health insights:

- **Spatial Risk Heatmap:** A 100-node vector grid visualizing regional risk density.
- **Agentic Workflow Visualizer:** Real-time monitoring of each agent node (Risk -> RAG -> Critique -> Router) during live TRIAGE.
- **Population Trends:** Interactive area charts for risk trajectory and severity distributions.

## 5. Temporal Case History

A longitudinal timeline feed inspired by Apple Health, allowing clinicians to review historical visits, monitor blood pressure trends visually via Recharts, and track escalation rates over time.

## 6. Secure JWT Authentication

Role-based JWT architecture allowing nurses and administrators to securely log cases to the edge system, while the Edge system securely authenticates with the Cloud API using a server-side API Key.
